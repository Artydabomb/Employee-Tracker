# Employee Tracker

## Description
To create a content management system (CMS) for a company that keeps track of their employees (an "org chart") by detailing their role in the company, their salary and their respective manager. This project incorporates the use of databases from MySQL, using the "MySQL" NPM package to retrieve data from a MySQL database (org_DB). The application uses an Inquirer Package to prompt input from a user.
